# TheaterReservationSystem
- Implemented a reservation system in Java for movie theaters that automatically places users in the most desirable seats available for their party
- Designed and implemented a command line interface based on MVC architecture so that users can reserve seats and see how many seats are available
- Created wheelchair accessibility so if users need such seats, the system will search for the best seats among the rows that are wheelchair accessible first
