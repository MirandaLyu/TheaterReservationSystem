# TheaterReservationSystem
- Implemented a reservation system in Java for movie theaters that automatically places users in the most desirable seats available for their party
- Designed and implemented a command line interface based on MVC architecture so that users can reserve seats and see how many seats are available
- Created wheelchair accessibility so if users need such seats, the system will search for the best seats among the rows that are wheelchair accessible first

- The user will interact with the system on the command line.
- he system will prompt the user with the phrase, “What would you like to do?”, and the user can enter: 
- “reserve <number>” to reserve that number of seats; 
- “show” to display the current available seating in the theater; 
- “done” to shut down the system.
